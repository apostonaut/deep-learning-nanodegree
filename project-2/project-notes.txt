And, I’d like to note that not all the content we’ve made is necessary for the second project. For the image recognition project, you’ll need:

- Intro to TensorFlow
- Deep Neural Networks
- Convolutional Networks
- Cloud Computing

If you are behind, you can skip the rest of the lessons and go straight into those so you can work on the project.
